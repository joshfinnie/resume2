\begin{bfcvSection}{Introduction}
I am an experienced polyglot software engineer who’s specialties lie in building large-scale, complex APIs,
interactive websites and engineering-improving internal tooling. I have over 10 years of software development
experience ranging from the fast-paced world of startups to working on many different contracts with a small,
independent team of developers. My current interests are in learning all I can about Rust and Go while staying
current in Python and Javascript.

\begin{bfcvSection}{Highlighted Personal Projects}

\begin{bfcvProjSubsection}{wasm-frontmatter}{https://www.npmjs.com/package/wasm-frontmatter}
\item A clone of grey-matter written in Rust. The rust code is used to generate Wasm code and is then released to NPM. My tests have found that Wasm-Frontmatter is three times faster than the javascript equivalent.
\end{bfcvProjSubsection}

\begin{bfcvProjSubsection}{PushFile}{https://www.npmjs.com/package/pushfile}
\item A project written in Node.js which allows you to push a file to Amazon Web Services S3 and gives you an URL in return. This is written using the latest javascript syntax and uses Babel to compile into ES5 to work as a command line application.
\end{bfcvProjSubsection}

\begin{bfcvProjSubsection}{JoshFinnie.com}{https://www.joshfinnie.com}
\item My personal blogging site written using the Astro.Build static site generator. Takes advantage of Tailwind CSS and is hosted on Netlify for high-availability. I write about learnings of software development and tutorials.
